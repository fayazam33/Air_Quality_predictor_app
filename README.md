### **Air Quality Prediction and Classification App 🌍💨**


😊
This **interactive Python application** predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on pollutant levels (**PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO2**, **CO**) and weather conditions (**temperature**, **humidity**). Using state-of-the-art **machine learning models**, it classifies air quality as **safe** or **unsafe** and provides visual performance comparisons across different models.

### **💻 Models Used**
- **Linear Regression** – Predicts AQI based on pollutant levels.
- **Polynomial Regression** – Enhances predictions with polynomial features.
- **Logistic Regression** – Classifies air quality into **safe** or **unsafe** categories.
- **Random Forest** – A robust model for classifying air quality.

### **🔧 Gradio Interface**
This app leverages **Gradio**, a Python library that provides a **user-friendly, interactive web interface** for machine learning models. Gradio simplifies the user experience by:
- **Adjusting input sliders** for pollutants and weather conditions.
- Providing an **instant visual comparison** of model performance.
- Offering a **shareable link** for easy deployment and demo sharing.
